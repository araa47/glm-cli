# glm cli

Genelec GLM cli (works over virtual midi, expects app to be open)

## Requirements

This assumes you have [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed

Simply run `direnv allow` to setup the environment, you can read the contents of [.envrc](.envrc) to see what it does behind the scenes.
